# **H-A-D-M** 
## Here to simplify your life
-----------------------------
Welcome to Health And Device Monitor, or HADM for short.
The purpose of this tool is to simplify the life of a Sys-Admin by helping with command writing.

Commands can be tedious and hard to write, that's why this shit exists! Because being lazy is what we like, right? 
(👉ﾟヮﾟ)👉

HADM is made with simplicity in mind, so just specify what you'd like to do and follow the steps! 
It's that S-H-R-I-M-P-L-E. (Why do I do this?...)

## Note!
### Sudo priviliges
HADM uses some tools that require SUDO privs, usually you shouldn't just give SUDO privs to a script that you've found online, but the script is relatively simple, so if you decide to read and find out how it works, you'll see that it will not be malicious and execute the `rm -rf /*` command and ruining your system in any way.
(If you're still skeptical, then what are you even doing on GitHub 😅)

### Dependencies
Note that there may be some dependencies that you may need to install, such as the package for SMART tools and something that wouldn't come downloaded by default in a system. Because we're just cool like that. I'll make sure to include an list of dependencies for your convencience.
