## Here to simplify your life

Welcome to Health And Device Monitor, or HADM for short.
The purpose of this tool is to simplify the life of a Sys-Admin by helping with command writing.

Commands can be tedious and hard to write, that's why this shit exists! Because being lazy is what we like, right?
(👉ﾟヮﾟ)👉

HADM is made with simplicity in mind, so just specify what you'd like to do and follow the steps!
It's that SHRIMPLE. (Why do I do this to myself?...)

At the moment, the following utility categories are planned(I have no detailed plan of structure at the moment.)
Finished categories are ticked with a checkbox:

- [X] Hardware status (CPU/Tasks/RAM(Short/Long)) using `top`
- [ ] Hardware temperatures using `lm-sensors`
  - [X] Check availibility on WSL/WSL2 (Does not work according to the devs)
  - [ ] Check availability on physical device (Should work...)
- [ ] S.M.A.R.T utility (Drive management/status) using `smartmon`
  - [X] Scan for drives.
  - [X] Retrieve drive data.
  - [ ] Health control of specified drive (`smartctl`).
- [X] Drive I/O (Drive I/O statistics and status) using `iostat`
- [ ] Network details (UP/DOWN/TYPE) using `ss`
  - [ ] Have to do this at a linux native device.
- [ ] Usage alert (Drive full, low battery) using `N/A`

Here are some things I'm planning on implementing to make usage of HADM easier!:

- [ ] Find a way to get the script crontabbed.
- [ ] Finish my python assignments... So I can work on this full-time :'D
- [ ] Optimize the code, so it doesn't look like actual spaghetti...

## Note

### Sudo priviliges

HADM uses some tools that require SUDO privs, usually you shouldn't just give SUDO privs to a script that you've found online, but the script is relatively simple, so if you decide to read and find out how it works, you'll see that it will not be malicious and execute any `MALICIOUS CODE` or `RUIN YOUR SYSTEM` in any kind of way.
(If you're still skeptical, then what are you even doing on GitHub 😅)

### Dependencies

Note that there may be some dependencies that you may need to install, such as the package for SMART tools and something that wouldn't come downloaded by default in a system. Because we're just cool like that. I'll make sure to include an list of dependencies for your convencience and make an script for installing the dependencies.
